# SOURCE — the Godot 4 project

The game's Godot 4 project lives here (`project.godot` at this level). Codex creates the empty project in group queue
line 19 and records the exact Godot version below; gameplay is built only from LOCKed designs in `GAME/APPROVED/`.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Engine | Godot 4.7.2.stable.official.ed1daf0bf |
| Language | GDScript |
| Scene format | Text (`.tscn`, `.tres`) |
| Art and sound | `assets/`, each item's source and licence in `assets/CREDITS.md` |

Open it: start Godot, choose Import, and pick `SOURCE/project.godot`.
